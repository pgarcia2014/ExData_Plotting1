# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project 1

* Make sure all the scripts are located in the current working directory.
* There are 5 scripts in the repository:
  * PrepEnvi.R (it must be executed first)
  * plot1.R
  * plot2.R
  * plot3.R
  * plot4.R
* The script "PrepEnvi.R" performs the following tasks:
  * Creates a folder named "CourseProject01".
  * Downloads the data file and saves it in the aforementioned folder. 
  * Unzip the file.
  * Filters the original data in order to get only the required data (2007-02-01, 2007-02-02). Saves the filtered data in a variable named "fdata". This variable will be used by the other scripts.
* The images will be saved in the current working directory.
* Run the following commands in RStudio
  * source("PrepEnvi.R")
  * source("plot1.R")
  * source("plot2.R")
  * source("plot3.R")
  * source("plot4.R")
